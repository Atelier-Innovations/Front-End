### Product Overview
The Product Overview widget contains information about the selected product, as well as a gallery of images.

Users can manipulate the image gallery component with either of the image carousel controls.

Clicking on the image gallery will morph the gallery into expanded view.

Clicking once more will enter zoom view, which hides the controls and allows the user to pan around the image at 2.5 zoom. Clicking on the image while in zoom view will cause it to revert back to expanded view.

Clicking on the expand icon while in expanded view will revert the view to default.

Cliking on a style icon will cause the style name, price, and image gallery to update according to the style selected.
